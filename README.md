# Riddle Locker!

Riddle Locker is a side project I'm working on! It lets users lock text behind "Riddles"

Riddles are prompts other users must solve to gain access to the locked text. Head over to riddlelocker.com to try it out!

I built this using Azure Static Web apps. It has a React frontend and an Azure Function backend. It's all being hosted within Azure.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
