# Riddle Locker!

Riddle Locker is a side project I'm working on! It lets users lock text behind "Riddles"

Riddles are prompts other users must solve to gain access to the locked text. Head over to [here](http://riddlelocker.com) to try it out!

I built this using Azure Static Web apps. It has a React frontend and an Azure Function backend. Data is stored in Azure Table Storage.

Thanks for trying it out!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
